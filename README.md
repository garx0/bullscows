# bullscows
Bulls and Cows game with changeable lengths of numbers and alphabet. Written on Python.
The algorithm is uneffective on large numbers though (working time grows exponentially with configuration parameters). So, choose large parameters carefully, because the program may get crashed by large calculations (for example, (16, 8) is almost OK but (24, 8) would probably freeze everything).
The game has text interface, maybe I will upgrade it later.
Playable online at: https://bullscows.garx.repl.run (or just launch bullscows.py with Python 3.7+)
